# SQL Cookbook — Learning in 30 Days

Practical SQL snippets built while studying SQL & data using the Chinook database (SQLite).

## Structure
- `day1.sql` — SELECT + LIMIT basics  
- `day2.sql` — WHERE filters, LIKE, ranges  
- (…continuing daily)

## How to Run (SQLite + DB Browser)
1. Open `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite` in DB Browser for SQLite.
2. Use the **Execute SQL** tab and run queries from the files.

## Goals
- Build fluency with SELECT/WHERE/JOIN/GROUP BY.
- Use window functions for analytics.
- Create PM-ready metrics (quality, throughput, contributors).
